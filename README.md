# .github - a hidden gem in repository management

All github meta files are stored here and automatically linked from all repositories in [terraform-aws-modules organization](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules).

You can read more about this feature and its supported functionality [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/creating-a-default-community-health-file#supported-file-types).

## Why?

I learned about `.github` repository during GitHub Satellite 2019 in Berlin. I have been thinking about ways to reduce copy-pasting between similar repositories for several years.
